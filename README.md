## About
I'm a first (soon to be second, although exam season has hands) year CompSci student at UKC. 
I've currently been working on a game engine called Macgyver in C++ using SDL2 and now box2D.
Additonally I have started developing the first tools for the engine under the name DuckTape, mostly in python. 

The naming for Macgyver comes as a tongue in cheek commentary on my code. Game Engines are hard, C++ is complicated, and together there's been some not brilliant ideas when working on them.
However overall it does work and I've been learning a lot from it. Current work is simultaniously adding new features and going back and improving the old to be more safe as I learn
about the language.

DuckTape then was a natural name for the tools (and one day hopefully proper IDE for the engine), as it helps with some of the complexities of the engine. For example creating the ComponentData destructor map, which is otherwise easy to miss. 

In addition to development I also have intrest in education, particularly EDI and Access. 

Previously I have worked for a year as an ambassador for Sussex's Access department where I helped deliver both their in house Access Program and with charities such as IntoUniversity. 
Currently I do some work as a tutor for Computer Science and Maths.
